ICRs Regarding the Virtual Group Election (§ 414.1315),"1464) and Section IV(b)(1) of Part I of that proposed Rule (pp 1465) – (1)(i) The Virtual Groups Election is a method of electing a virtual group of individuals to participate in the health care system. The virtual groups are not required to be members of a single health insurance plan. (2)   The Virtual groups may be selected by a physician or other health professional. A physician may select a group based on the characteristics of each individual. For example, a doctor may choose a person who is not a member of an individual health plan, or a health provider may elect to elect a new group. In addition, the physician must select the group to which the individual is eligible. If the doctor determines that the virtual members are eligible, he or she may use the information provided by the patient to determine the eligibility of such a patient."
